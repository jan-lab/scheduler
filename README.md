# Interview Scheduler

With the Interview Scheduler, a user is able to create, edit, and delete an appointment. An appointment is created by selecting a timeslot on a specific day of the week with a student name and an interviewer from the list of interviewers provided. As appointments are created and deleted, the "# spots remaining" indicator is updated.
